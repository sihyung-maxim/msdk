## Description

This example demonstates various features of the Flash Controller (page erase and write), and how to use the CRC to compute a CRC value. In the terminal window, type the command that you wish to execute. The available commands are "write" (writes a text string to flash), "read" (reads text from flash), "erase" (erases the flash page being operated on) and "crc" (computes the CRC value of the entire flash page.) For more details on how to input these commands, enter "help" in the terminal window.

*** NOTE ***: Attempting to overwrite flash will return error. If you want to overwrite an address you must first erase.


## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

(None - this project builds as a standard example)

## Setup

### Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Select RX0 and TX0 on Headers JP1 and JP3 (UART 0).
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Close jumper JP1 (LED1 EN).
-   Close jumper JP2 (LED2 EN).

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

*************** Flash Control CLI Example ***************

This example demonstrates various features of the Flash Controller
(page erase and write), and how to use the CRC to compute the
CRC value of an array. Enter commands in the terminal window.

CLI Initialized! Enter 'help' to see a list of available commands.

$ help
help

write:
  Usage: write <word offset> <text>
  Description: Writes text string to flash starting at the 32-bit word in the
    flash page specified by "word offset" (e.g. word offset=3 -> address
    offset=0xC, word offset=4 -> address offset=0x10)

erase:
  Usage: erase
  Description: Erases page in flash being operated on

read:
  Usage: read <word offset> <number of letters>
  Description: Reads text from flash starting at the 32-bit word in the flash
    page specified by "word offset" (e.g. word offset=3 -> address offset=0xC,
    word offset=4 -> address offset=0x10)

crc:
  Usage: crc
  Description: Calculates CRC of entire flash page
