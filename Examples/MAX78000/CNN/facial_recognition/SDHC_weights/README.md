## Description

This example writes CNN weights for the FaceID model onto an SD card as a binary file.  It can be used to load the model onto an SD card if an adapter is unable to do so from a host PC.

Alternatively, if the host PC has a microSD card adapter the [weights_2.bin](weights_2.bin) file can be loaded into the root directory of the card from the PC.

Once loaded, the SD card is ready for use with the [facial_recognition](../README.md) demo.

## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

* This project is only supported for the MAX78000FTHR board.

## Setup

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector on the MAX78000FTHR.
-   Insert a microSDHC card into the SD card slot on the bottom of the board.
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the FTHR's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Flash and run the project.

## Expected Output
