## Description

This project demonstrates object detection running on the MAX78000CAM02 board.  It runs the pre-trained ["facedet_tinierssd"](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis/blob/develop/networks/ai85-facedet-tinierssd.yaml) model to perform face detection with bounding boxes.  The firmware captures 168x224 RGB565 images from the GC0308 camera module and feed them to the CNN accelerator.  LED indicators show the output status of the model when it has detected a face.

## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

* This project is pre-configured for the MAX78000CAM02 board only.

## Required Connections

* Supply power to the MAX78000CAM02 board over its QWIIC connector (1.6V - 3.6V)
* Connect the GC0308 camera module with its back-face text aligned to the outer edge of the PCB.

* (optional) Connect a serial terminal to the port presented by the PICO debugger to see console message logs.  The baud rate is 115200. 

## Expected Output

After flashing and running the demo, the MAX78000CAM02 board should be oriented as follows.

![MAX78000CAM02 Orientation](res/cam02_orientation.jpg)

* The **green** LED is the **inference** indicator.  Every pulse indicates an image capture and inference.
* The **red** LED is the **face detected** indicator.  When this LED is lit, the MAX78000CAM02 has detected a face in frame.
